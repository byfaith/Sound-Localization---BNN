# Sound-Localization---BNN
A binary neural network model was trained for sound localization task. In this project, only the neuron activation is binarized while the weighs are still in full precision. A test accuracy of 12.40% was achieved after training for 100 epochs.

For information about the CNN model and sound localization dataset used please refer to the following paper:
